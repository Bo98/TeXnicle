<h2>TeXnicle 2.1</h2>
<p>
This version of TeXnicle includes improvements to the look and feel, some nice new features, and a
large number of bug fixes.
<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>New "Jump to file" menu option offers a quick way to jump between files in projects.</li>
  <li>A new parsed log file view is available on the integrated console. Double-clicking
    detected info, warnings and errors will jump to that location in the source code. Parsing
    the many flavours of log files is challenging, so you millage may vary. Please report any
    issues.</li>
  <li>Changes to engine handling:
    <ul>
      <li>Engines are now passed an additional parameter (6th argument) which is the current typesetting run
        number. As such, TeXnicle is now responsible for doing repeated typesetting runs, rather than the
        engine. This allows for finer flow control, error handling and provides a more robust infrastructure.</li>
      <li>The built-in engines have been updated to perform a single typesetting run. Additional engine features
        (like running bibtex) then depend on that run number. <b>Note: Custom engines may need to be updated</b>.</li>
    </ul></li>
  <li>The document outline now supports custom section commands for each document level. These can be
    set in the new 'Outline' preferences tab. The outline colors are now set here too.</li>
  <li>Jump bar changes:
    <ul>
      <li>Added option to enable/disable jumpbar in general preferences.</li>
      <li>Added option to disable linenumbers in jumpbar (can lead to performance improvements in large files).</li>
      <li>Optimised section list building in jumpbar.</li>
    </ul></li>
  <li>Documents now remember the live update setting.</li>
  <li>Documents now remember the pdf thumbnails setting.</li>
  <li>Added a new wrapping mode to wrap to the editor window width.</li>
  <li>Added support for \addbibresource{} command for citation completion.</li>
  <li>Added support for subfiles package.</li>
  <li>Added support for \component command in document outline for ConTeXt users.</li>
  <li>Added new menu item to hide navigator panel. And added default keyboard shortcuts for this and existing "Show Navigator" menu item.</li>
  <li>Enhanced overflow menu in project tabbed editor, allowing tabs in the overflow to be closed or moved to the front.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
This release includes a large number of bug fixes, the main ones are:
<ul>
  <li>Bug fix: document outline now properly includes files which have a space in the name.</li>
  <li>Bug fix for spellchecker language settings which were not always remembered on the editor.<li>
    <li>Bug fix for expanding simple code snippets with no placeholders where the cursor would end up at the beginning of the snippet.</li>
    <li>Bug fix for PDF printing on some 10.6.8 machines.</li>
