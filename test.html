<h2>TeXnicle 2.2</h2>
<p>
Introducing 'themes'. Your current settings for colors and fonts will be converted into a theme. You can create your own themes or choose from one of the built-in themes. Themes are a simple plist format and so can be created in a text editor or by editing the theme in the preferences.
