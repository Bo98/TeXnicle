This release contains various minor bug fixes, optimisations and the ability to set your own colors for the document outline view.

<u>Some changes of note</u>
<ul>
  <li>The Spelling navigator no longer shows the possible corrections in the table. It turns out that gathering the possible corrections
    for all misspelled words is <i>very</i> computationally expensive for any reasonable sized documents. The corrections are just presented
    now on demand.</li>
</ul>
