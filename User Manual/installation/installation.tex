\chapter{Installation, Setup and Requirements}
\label{ch:installation}

\texnicle\ expects you to have an installed \LaTeX\ typesetting system on your
machine. By default, \texnicle\ is setup to work with installations of MacTeX\,\cite{mactex}.
If you have an alternative \LaTeX\ installation, you may need to setup some
paths. In particular, you may need to copy and edit one or more of the built-in
engines that \texnicle\ uses to typeset documents. That is described in section
\ref{sec:engines}.

In addition to the engines discussed above, \texnicle\ uses some commands for
typesetting code snippet previews. These are set in the Preferences pane
``Palette \& Library'' and are discussed further in section
\ref{sec:preferences:paletteandlibrary}.
