\chapter{Introducing \texnicle}
\label{ch:introduction}

\texnicle\ is an editor and project manager for producing documents using
\LaTeX\ and similar typesetting languages. \texnicle\ has been under development
since 2010 and is intended to provide a fast, feature-rich environment for
writing \LaTeX\ documents under Mac OS X. Employing all the features of modern
Mac OS X applications, \texnicle\ fits right at home on a Mac. 

One of the main design drivers for \texnicle\ was to produce an editing
environment similar to Xcode\,\cite{xcode} the development environment Apple provides for
building applications on Mac OS X.
