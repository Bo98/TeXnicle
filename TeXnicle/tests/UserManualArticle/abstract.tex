As the launch of LISA Pathfinder draws near, more and more effort is being put in
to the preparation of the data analysis activities that will be carried out during
the mission operations. The operations phase of the mission will be composed
of a series of experiments that will be carried out on the satellite. These experiments
will be directed and analysed by the data analysis team, which is part of
the operations team. The operations phase will last about 90 days, during which
time the data analysis team aims to fully characterise the LISA Pathfinder satellite,
and in particular, its core instrument the LISA Technology Package. By analysing
the various couplings present in the system, the different noise sources
that will disturb the system, and through the  identification of the key physical
parameters of the system, a detailed noise budget of the instrument will be
constructed that will allow the performance of the different subsystems to be assessed
and projected towards LISA. This paper describes the various aspects of the
full data analysis chain that are needed to successfully characterise LPF and
build up the noise budget during mission operations.
