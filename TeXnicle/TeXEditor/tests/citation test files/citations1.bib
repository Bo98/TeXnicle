@article{adrienDriftMode,
	Abstract = {The drag-free experiment on-board LISA Pathfinder, the LISA Technology Package (LTP), has for its main science mission the proof of a low disturbance noise level. It is measured differentially between two test-masses whose relative motion is perturbed by their respective capacitive actuator noise. In order to suppress this noise source the drift mode actuation scheme uses very short impulses to produce kicks. This way the test-masses motion between two kicks is a free parabolic flight and can be used for a spectral estimation of the remaining noise sources, allowing us to distinguish between external noise sources and actuation noise. This mode will be helpful in the case of a high actuation noise or to investigate some unexpected external noise source, but the foremost reason being that this experiment is closer to the ultimate LISA experiment in terms of actuation noise. It must be implemented on-board taking into account the constraints of a space-borne experiment in terms of robustness, usability and existing software and hardware architecture.},

This analysis includes environmental effects that will be present in the sensor. Finally, we discuss open questions regarding the GS for LTP and LISA, ground testing, and verification issues.},

This paper describes the LTP measurement of random, position-independent forces acting on the test masses. In addition to putting an overall upper limit for all source of random force noise, LTP will measure the conversion of several key disturbances into acceleration noise and thus allow a more detailed characterization of the drag-free performance to be expected for LISA.},

	Abstract = {The top-level requirement of the LISA Pathfinder mission is the verification of pure relative free fall between two test masses with an accuracy of about 3 × 10 −14 m s −2 Hz −1/2 in a measurement bandwidth between 1 mHz and 30 mHz. The drag-free control system is one of the key technology elements that shall be verified. Its design is strongly connected to the overall system and experimental design, in particular, via the following issues: the differential test mass motion and thus the science measurements depend on the control system; design constraints, such as negative stiffness of test masses and electrostatic actuation cross-talk, have an impact on science and control system performance; derived requirements for control system components, in particular, the micro-propulsion system, must be within reasonable and feasible limits. In this paper, the control design approach is outlined and the system-related issues are addressed.},

@article{Hewitson11,
	Abstract = {As the launch of LISA Pathfinder (LPF) draws near, more and more effort is being put in to the preparation of the data analysis activities that will be carried out during the mission operations. The operations phase of the mission will be composed of a series of experiments that will be carried out on the satellite. These experiments will be directed and analysed by the data analysis team, which is part of the operations team. The operations phase will last about 90 days, during which time the data analysis team aims to fully characterize the LPF, and in particular, its core instrument the LISA Technology Package. By analysing the various couplings present in the system, the different noise sources that will disturb the system, and through the identification of the key physical parameters of the system, a detailed noise budget of the instrument will be constructed that will allow the performance of the different subsystems to be assessed and projected towards LISA. This paper describes the various aspects of the full data analysis chain that are needed to successfully characterize the LPF and build up the noise budget during mission operations.},
