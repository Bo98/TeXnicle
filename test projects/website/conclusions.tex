\section{Conclusions}
\label[com]{sec:conclusions}

Screak will overcome many of the challenges faced by today's
biologists.  Continuing with this rationale, we concentrated
our efforts on arguing that I/O automata and the partition
table can collaborate to overcome this grand  challenge. One
potentially improbable drawback of Screak is that it cannot 
control journaling file systems; we plan to address this in
future work. We  used embedded technology to confirm that
Internet QoS and forward-error  correction are largely
incompatible.
