# HOW TO USE THIS FILE:  #
##########################
#
# 0) Set the variable LILYPONDFOLDER below to the absolute path
#    of the folder containing the Lilypond application.
#    For example, if you have put the Lilypond app in a folder
#    called Music inside the Applications folder, the path
#    is /Applications/Music and the line below must read
#
#       set LILYPONDFOLDER = /Applications/Music
#
#    If Lilypond is installed in the Applications folder,
#    then just skip this step.
#
set TSBIN=$HOME/Library/TeXShop/bin
set LTMKBIN=$HOME/Library/TeXShop/bin/tslatexmk
set LILYPONDFOLDER = /Applications
set path = ($path $LILYPONDFOLDER/LilyPond.app/Contents/Resources/bin/)

#
# 1) Rename this file by dropping the .txt suffix
#    and put it into your Library/TeXShop/Engines folder.
#
# 2) Run the Terminal application (which you find in the Utilities folder)
#    and, in the Terminal window, type:
#
#       cd  ~/Library/TeXShop/Engines
#
#    then, press the Enter key and type:
#
#       chmod +x Lilypond-LaTeX.engine
#
#    and press Enter again. The above command makes this script executable.
#
# 3) Switch to TeXShop, open a LaTeX file with Lilypond code,
#    choose the Lilypond-LaTeX engine and typeset!
#

# HINT
#######
# 
# Write:
#
#    %!TEX TS-program = Lilypond-LaTeX
#
# at the very beginning of your document: this will let TeXShop
# automatically switch to the right engine!
#
#######
# NOTE about including pictures with \includegraphics:
#######
#
# you may want to include the following in the preamble of your
# source file:
#
#    \usepackage{graphicx}
#    \graphicspath{{../}}
#
# since the generated LaTeX file is put into a subdirectory
# of the current directory.
#
# In general, if your directory structure is as follows
#
#   MyLilyPondDocs/
#   MyLilyPondDocs/lilybook.lytex
#   MyLilyPondDocs/MyPictures/
#   MyLilyPondDocs/MyPictures/pic1.eps
#   ...
#   MyLilyPondDocs/MyPictures/picn.eps
#
#   the preamble of lilybook.lytex should contain:
#
#    \graphicspath{{../MyPictures/}}
#
# The trailing slash "/" is required!
#
# Delete existing output (PDF, Synctex, IDX) file
 rmdir "$1:r"-out
 rm "$1:r".pdf
  rm "$1:r".synctex.gz

  # Create directory to put all temporary stuff
  # macht Lilypond-Book alleine
  mkdir -p "$1:r"-out/
    # Invoke L-B
     lilypond-book --output="$1:r"-out --pdf "$1"
     cd "$1:r"-out
     ${LTMKBIN}/latexmk -pdf -r "${LTMKBIN}/xelatexmkrc" "$1"
    # Copy output (PDF) file to parent directory
     cp "$1:r".pdf ..
     cp "$1:r".synctex.gz ..
  # Delete temporary stuff
   rm -rf *
 cd ..
  # Delete (empty) temp directory
   rmdir "$1:r"-out
  # Display output (PDF) file
# open "$1:r".pdf
