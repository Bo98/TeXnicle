\begin{abstract}
This article presents a simulation model of the magnetic field generated by electric energy distribution and transport facilities.  The aim of this paper is to assess the model’s compliance with current international regulations and recommendations.  
One of the principal advantages of this model is its relative simplicity, as it represents the facility's elements by using a conductor network.  This network is energized by injecting a system of currents that model the load state of the facility.  The conductor network is subsequently analyzed as a conventional electrical circuit.
This paper applies the model to the specific case of an outdoor substation and the results are later validated when compared with the magnetic field measurements taken at the facility.

\section{Introduction}
\IEEEPARstart{O}{ur} modern lifestyles are inconceivable without the extensive use of electric energy.  The use of electric energy, is by nature, linked to the existence of electromagnetic fields in the areas around the equipment and facilities that generate, transport and distribute it.

Electromagnetic fields are of great interest to engineers, scientists and society in general due to their diverse possible consequences. In certain circumstances they cause potentials and currents to appear in electric facilities.  They also disturb the performance of other electric and electronic devices. The interaction of electromagnetic fields with living organisms and their possible physiological effects on them, is also being studied \cite{EMFWHO} as it is a controversial issue which generates concern and uneasiness in society. As a result, it is necessary to quantify the values of the electromagnetic fields associated with the transportation and distribution of electric energy.

This article describes an electromagnetic field simulation model applicable to different types of electric energy transportation and distribution facilities.  We apply this model to the particular case of an outdoor transformer substation and present it here, in this paper.

The fundamental objective of this paper is to determine if the magnetic field’s existing level in a facility of this type is below the maximum value established by current legislation in different countries. These limits are usually based on the recommendations of the ICNIRP \cite{ICNIRP1998} (currently under revision) and \cite{ICNIRP2010} with 500 $\mu T$ for workers and 100 $\mu T$ for the general public. Similar recommendations are given by IEEE in \cite{2002hm}.

Many authors have addressed the subject of measuring electric and magnetic fields in transmission and distribution facilities \cite{Safigianni2005, Safigianni2009}.

A smaller number have addressed the problem of modeling these types of facilities to simulate and calculate these fields, usually oversimplifying their assumptions \cite{Filippopoulos2005,Tzinevrakis2008}. 

Some researchers \cite{Dawalibi1994} have developed methodologies to analyze more realistic systems, based on a more complete and rigorous solving of electromagnetic (Maxwell) equations.  However, these approaches are very complex and difficult to implement in a practical application, (such as the one presented in this paper) nor is any accuracy required in these methodologies. These more complex methods \cite{dawalibiselby,grcevdawalibi} must be used when higher frequency energizations are involved (i.e. transitory conditions).

Usually electric and magnetic fields generated by electric facilities are coupled, and Maxwell equations must be solved to obtain them.  However, in many cases and under certain conditions, some approximations can be assumed, and the electric and magnetic fields can be calculated independently. This is true for fields created by power lines and substations under steady-state conditions where the quasi-stationary approximation of the magnetic fields can be adopted.

The methodology used in this paper to compute magnetic fields in the vicinity of electric energy transmission and distribution facilities is based on modeling the system of conductors as a frequency-dependent electric circuit. Generally, this circuit consists of resistive, inductive and capacitive elements which are calculated by using basic electromagnetic equations. The analysis of this circuit using conventional techniques allows one to obtain the currents and voltages in all the conductors. Thus, the magnetic field in the vicinity of lines and substations can be computed by superimposing the individual contribution of each current conductor at any point.

In previous articles \cite{OteroICHQP98, Otero1999}, the authors used a similar technique to study the behavior of grounding systems, which obtained very good results. A software application (VCEM) was developed by the authors based on the considerations mentioned above. With this tool we are able to calculate magnetic and electric fields generated by a network of energized conductors, such as electric power lines and substations. In this paper, however; only magnetic fields are considered.
 
This paper has been divided into two phases:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item{Field work.} Initially, a campaign to measure the magnetic induction values at the selected facility was carried out.  The measurements were taken at a series of points arranged along 4 profiles at the edges of the facility and at a height of 1 meter above ground\cite{IEEEStd644}.
	\item{Computer simulation.} This part consists of the simulation and analysis of the magnetic fields at the facility, in conditions similar to the ones existing at the time of the measurements. The method proposed (implemented in the VCEM application) was used to carry out these simulations.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Model description}

The methodology used in this paper to calculate the magnetic fields generated by the substation is based on modeling the whole system as a set of thin, interconnected conductors placed in any position or orientation. 

The analysis consists of studying all the inductive, capacitive and conductive (when conductors are buried) couplings between the different system conductors and applying the following simplifications:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Rectilinear conductors. This means no curves can be calculated; they must be modeled on straight conductors.
	\item Thin conductors.  This assumes conductors are longer than they are wide.
	\item In order to simplify mathematical equations, all conductors are assumed to be round.
\end{enumerate}

Consequently, the problem is reduced to obtaining the equivalent circuit with \emph{r} branches and \emph{n} nodes (see Fig. \ref{fig:circuitoequivalente}). Each branch consists of an ohmic resistance and self and mutual inductances. These three elements are calculated using common expressions found in the bibliography \cite{Otero1999,Paul2007tn}. Capacitive and conductive (when bare-buried conductors exist) couplings between any two conductors are also considered and they are modeled by concentrating these phenomena in the circuit nodes (as a kind of $\pi$ model). Conductive couplings are only included when bare-buried conductors exist.

Furthermore, circuit parameters depend only on the physical characteristics of the conductors and the electrical frequency. 

\begin{figure}[!tb]
	\centering
		\includegraphics[width=2.9 in]{../resources/circuitoequivalente.eps}
		\caption{Equivalent circuit}
	\label{fig:circuitoequivalente}
\end{figure}

The resulting circuit is calculated using a conventional nodal analysis technique.  The system is energized by injecting the appropriate nodes with single sinusoidal currents \cite{Otero1999}, and so a current source $\bar{F}_{j}$ is connected to each node. 

Consequently, a voltage appears between each node and a common reference point (typically the earth). With those voltages, it is possible to define a branch voltage which is calculated as the mean value of its extreme nodes; they are represented by a column vector $[\bar{U}]$. Then, with the branch voltages, the currents flowing through the branches can be calculated using the following equation:
\begin{align}
	\label{eq:bcurrent}
	\left[\bar{I} \right] = \left[G \right] \cdot \left[ \bar{U} \right]
\end{align}
where $[G]$ is the conductance matrix.

From this circuit analysis, all the node voltages and longitudinal branch currents are obtained by solving the following linear system: 
\begin{align}
	\label{eq:full}
	\left[\bar{F} \right] = \left[Y \right] \cdot \left[ \bar{V} \right]
\end{align}
where $\left[Y \right]$ is the nodal admittance matrix of the circuit, $\left[\bar{F} \right]$ is the vector of external nodal current sources and $\left[\bar{V} \right]$ the vector of nodal voltages which are the unknowns to be solved.

It is easy to obtain the longitudinal currents by computing the obtained node voltages. 

With the computed longitudinal currents circulating through the conductors and using the Biot-Savart equation, the magnetic fields can be calculated at any desired point $P$ by superimposing the contribution of every $i$:
\begin{align}
	\label{eq:biot}
    B=\sum^{r}_{i=0} {\frac{\mu_{0}I_{i}}{4\pi}\int{\frac{\overrightarrow{dl}_{i}\times \overrightarrow{r}_{iP}}{r^{2}_{iP}}}}	
\end{align}

The maximum frequency of applicability of this method is limited by the assumed quasi-stationary approximation of the electromagnetic fields. Considering the usual size of the facilities contemplated (from ten to a hundred meters), the method can be applied to up to tens of $kHz$.

\end{figure}

\section{Simulated system}

The facility studied is a conventional, HV/MV air-insulated, outdoor substation, with a double bus (single breaker) arrangement (see Fig. \ref{fig:substationdiagram}) located in a medium-size city (Pop. 300,000) in the northwest of Spain.

The substation feeds a 15 $kV$ distribution system through three 40 $MVA$, 132/15 $kV$ transformers. On the high voltage side the substation interconnects four 132 $kV$ overhead lines and one 132 $kV$ underground line. Fig. \ref{fig:substationdiagram} shows the one-line diagram of the simulated substation.

%%FIGURE Substation wire
\begin{figure*}[h]
	\centering
		\includegraphics[width=6.1in]{../resources/substationwire.eps}
	\caption{3D wired model of the substation.}
	\label{fig:substationwire}
\end{figure*}

The magnetic field in the substation switchyard was simulated. To do this, both the active conductors and the passive structural elements were modeled using straight line segments with the appropriate sizes and resistivity to reliably represent the real behavior of the conductors.  Specifically, the elements were modeled using conductor segments. The elements used are the following:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Overhead and underground power line conductors.
	\item Busbars, consisting of twin bundled conductors.
	\item Breaker and isolator elements.
	\item Grounding system, including aerial and buried grids.
	\item Structures supporting elements, busbars and aerial grounding grid.
\end{enumerate}

The length, section and resistivity specifications of the different types of the active and passive conductors currently in the substation were obtained from the blueprints facilitated by the company, or in some cases, from directly observing the facility.

From this data, using almost 2000 segments (see the Fig. \ref{fig:substationwire}), the conductor network used in the simulation of the substation was built. 

The values of currents flowing through the various conductors are obtained from the load state of the substation at any time.  The case presented in this paper corresponds to what should be considered an average weekday morning in spring when magnetic field measurements were taken.  The substation load status is given in table \ref{tab:load}. 

Although only absolute values are shown in this table, the respective phases were considered in the simulation to take into account power factors, power flow directions and phase shifts due to the transformers' winding configuration.

\section{Model Validation}
The substation described above was simulated based on the proposed methodology. Here, computed values and measurements of the magnetic field in the outdoor part of the facility are presented.

In order to check the accuracy of the simulation model, a set of measurements were carried out on the substation. 

Three tools were used to measure and record the values of the magnetic field and determine its position around the substation \cite{ieeeMStand}. They are shown in table \ref{tab:tools} with their most significant technical specifications.

The size of the facility and the magnetic field generated were considered to ensure that the accuracy and working range of the tools used were appropriate.  A tripod was also used to assure that all measurements were taken at a constant height in accordance with the recommendations cited above. 

The magnetic field analyzer scale was set up to measure $\mu T$ and a frequency bandwidth between 30 $Hz$ and 2 $kHz$ (the closest to 50 $Hz$), to avoid registering harmonics or communication signals.

We decided to sample the magnetic field every 2 meters and used a meter wheel to measure the distance. The distance between a given point and the facility reference point was recorded with the laser meter.

After taking the measurements, the floor plan of the facility was updated with the new values.

The values obtained from the magnetic field were compared with the computed values and the results are shown in this paper. 

The measurements were conducted on four straight profiles surrounding the study area as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:slices}. The coordinates of the profiles' endpoints are listed in table \ref{tab:cond}.

Two different alternatives were proposed to calculate the magnetic fields.  

In a first, simpler version, only the active conductors of the system were considered. These active conductors (phases of all the lines, busbars and other active elements of the facility) are the main source of the magnetic field. The results obtained with this model do not match the measured values very well. 

In the second version, a more complete model including both active and passive conductors, was used. The passive conductors represent mainly structural elements (supports) and the grounding system (aerial and buried conductors). Although these passive elements are not directly energized, they are subjected to induced currents and have a significant impact on the resulting field. In this second case the computed values coincide greatly with the measured values. 

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
		\includegraphics[width=3in]{../resources/slice1.eps}
		\caption{Simulated and measured magnetic field along profile 1.}
	\label{fig:slice1}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
		\includegraphics[width=3in]{../resources/slice2.eps}
		\caption{Simulated and measured magnetic field along profile 2.}
	\label{fig:slice2}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
		\includegraphics[width=3in]{../resources/slice3.eps}
		\caption{Simulated and measured magnetic field along profile 3.}

\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[htt]
	\centering
		\includegraphics[width=3in]{../resources/slice4.eps}
		\caption{Simulated and measured magnetic field along profile 4.}
	\label{fig:slice4}
\end{figure}

Fig. \ref{fig:slice1} to \ref{fig:slice4} show the measured and simulated (in both versions) magnetic fields along the four described profiles. The proposed model’s validity has been demonstrated with the results. Another important conclusion reached is the need to include all the passive conductors (not only the active ones) in the model to achieve acceptable results in the simulation.

A statistical evaluation of the errors between the simulated (complete version) and measured values in the four profiles was made, obtaining an average error of $9.2\%$.

Some sources of error have been identified, such as:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Transformers are not internally modeled, and only external conductor elements are considered. 
	\item Some possible errors in the electrical and geometric data of the substation.
	\item The variation of the load state of the substation during the measuring process. (In the simulation a fixed load state was considered).
	\item Lines and busbars were considered as perfectly balanced.
	\item In general, some simplifying assumptions were made to reduce the complexity of the model.
\end{itemize}

Once the simulation model is proven as valid, it can be used to simulate other cases. 

In this paper we evaluate an entire substation switchyard.  The area studied comprises a rectangle measuring 90.5 (x axis) by 62.5 (y axis) meters. This rectangle, or rather, grid, with points spaced 0.5 meters apart at a height of 1 meter over the soil plane was the evaluated area.

\begin{figure}[!h]
	\centering
		\includegraphics[width=3.4in]{../resources/halfloadsurf.eps}
		\caption{3D plot of the computed magnetic field}
	    \label{fig3wq3:halfs} 
\end{figure}

A 3D representation of the calculated magnetic field values, which uses a logarithmic scale used to improve visualization, is shown in Fig. \ref{fig3wq3:halfs}. In the worst areas, values up to 150 $\mu T$ are reached. These values should not cause concern as they are not accessible to the general public. Only workers can be at those points and international regulations limit occupational exposure to 500 $\mu T$.

As was expected, the highest values are obtained in the points close to conductors subjected to high currents.

The same case is represented in Fig. \ref{fig:halfsp} using a contour plot. Here we have a better view of the most critical zones of the facility. 

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
		\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{../resources/halfloadsurfplan.eps}
		\caption{Contour plot of the computed magnetic field.}
	\label{fig:halfsp}
\end{figure}

Finally, the same substation was simulated in a hypothetical case of maximum load. 
All the transformers and busbars were assumed to be subjected to the highest possible load and magnetic field peaks of 340 $\mu T$ were reached at the critical points of the switchyard.

Some interesting conclusions could be made from the results regarding the exposure:
\begin{itemize}
	\item In the substation's vicinity, where the general public can get closer, the obtained values of the magnetic field are far below the regulatory limit of 100 $\mu T$.
	\item In the area only accessible to workers, the existing magnetic field is significantly lower than the occupational exposure limit of 500 $\mu T$.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusions}

This paper presents a simplified model of a simulated magnetic field generated by transmission and distribution facilities. 

The methodology proposed was used to evaluate a typical HV outdoor substation. 
The results that were obtained were compared with the values measured at the facility and a good correlation was obtained. We have made the following conclusions:

First of all, it is quite remarkable that passive metallic elements (such as the structure) cause major interference in the magnetic field.  This should be taken into consideration in all subsequent 
studies. 

In this study a  umber of simplifications were assumed in the mathematical equations and in the electrical modeling of the active and passive elements. Based on the results obtained one can conclude that these simplifications are acceptable, at least, for evaluating the magnetic fields both inside and outside the substation.

Since the results obtained were accurate, it has been shown that this method can be used to check for compliance with health recommendations, even during the design process.

Lastly, the authors wish to stress the importance of having complete and updated information on all the elements of the substation, such as buried lines, breakers, busbars, transformers and metallic structures, in order to create a system model which is as accurate as possible.

This methodology has been used in other types of distribution facilities, including MV/LV substations with different configurations, and again the results were satisfactory.
