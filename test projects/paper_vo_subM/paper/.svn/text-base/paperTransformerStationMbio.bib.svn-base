abstract = {Time-varying magnetic stimulation of the central nervous system is nowadays a promising therapeutic approach already used to alleviate the symptoms in a variety of neurological disorders. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is an example of a successful application involving specific patterns of magnetic field (MF) for therapeutic use, which provides clinical improvement in movement disorders or depression. Other neuromodulation strategies consist in proposing several orders of magnitude lower magnetic stimuli that are more flexible in terms of shape and frequency of the signal. However, the refinement of both of these techniques is limited due to the lack of understanding of the underlying mechanisms supporting the interaction between the magnetic stimulus and brain tissue. To provide insights into the modulation of neuronal activity by extremely low-frequency (ELF) MF, we present biophysical modeling results regarding 1) single neuron exposure to an ELF MF, and 2) neuronal network exposure to an ELF MF. These results shed light on the effect of ELF MFs on neuronal activity from the single cell to the network level, and illustrate the importance of a number of factors both in ELF MF characteristics and brain tissue properties in determining the outcome of the exposure. These principles may guide future therapeutic developments.},

In many cases the induced EMF is the parameter of interest. An action potential of about 45 mV has been found to be biologically significant in reducing traumatic edema. The possibility of application of a magnetic field in curing traumatic inflammation is quite limited at this stage. We still have a long way to go in understanding the intensity and the duration of exposure to many biological systems as well as the timing of exposure relative to various biological cycles. However, it is visualised that electromagnetic therapy is promising for application as an affordable biotechnology for handling the health problems for both the rural and urban mass},

abstract = {Extremely low frequency (ELF) electromagnetic fields (EMF) are categorized as non-ionising radiation (NIR). They are generally generated by overhead transmission power lines. A study of ELF EMF was conducted at residential areas around the transmission line located at Kelang Valley. The objectives of the study were to determine the strength of the ELF EMF present besides to assess the potential exposure received by future residents. The surveys were carried out using PMM model EHP50A and EMDEX instruments based on standard measurement procedures and protocol recommended by IEEE. The results obtained were compared against the permissible exposure limits recommended by International commission of non-ionising radiation protection (ICNIRP) for members of public to ensure that they are acceptable in term of safety. This paper highlights some of the findings at the Study site. The results obtained indicates that the ELF EMF radiation level within the study area (outside ROW) generated by the power lines but their field strengths were within the permissible exposure limits by ICNIRP which were 0.03\% and 5.26\% for magnetic and electric field respectively. Both field strengths were found to drop very significantly against distance from the power lines where closer distances always showed higher field strengths.},

abstract = {The essential textbook for electrical engineering students and professionals-now in a valuable new edition

The increasing use of high-speed digital technology requires that all electrical engineers have a working knowledge of transmission lines. However, because of the introduction of computer engineering courses into already-crowded four-year undergraduate programs, the transmission line courses in many electrical engineering programs have been relegated to a senior technical elective, if offered at all.

Now, Analysis of Multiconductor Transmission Lines, Second Edition has been significantly updated and reorganized to fill the need for a structured course on transmission lines in a senior undergraduate- or graduate-level electrical engineering program. In this new edition, each broad analysis topic, e.g., per-unit-length parameters, frequency-domain analysis, time-domain analysis, and incident field excitation, now has a chapter concerning two-conductor lines followed immediately by a chapter on MTLs for that topic. This enables instructors to emphasize two-conductor lines or MTLs or both.

In addition to the reorganization of the material, this Second Edition now contains important advancements in analysis methods that have developed since the previous edition, such as methods for achieving signal integrity (SI) in high-speed digital interconnects, the finite-difference, time-domain (FDTD) solution methods, and the time-domain to frequency-domain transformation (TDFD) method. Furthermore, the content of Chapters 8 and 9 on digital signal propagation and signal integrity application has been considerably expanded upon to reflect all of the vital information current and future designers of high-speed digital systems need to know.

Complete with an accompanying FTP site, appendices with descriptions of numerous FORTRAN computer codes that implement all the techniques in the text, and a brief but thorough tutorial on the SPICE/PSPICE circuit analysis program, Analysis of Multiconductor Transmission Lines, Second Edition is an indispensable textbook for students and a valuable resource for industry professionals.}}
